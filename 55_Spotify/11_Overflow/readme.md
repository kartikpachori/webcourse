# 1. Introduction to Overflow Property
## 1.1 Purpose of the Overflow Property
In CSS, the overflow property is used to manage content overflow within a box. If the content inside a box is larger than the box itself, overflow properties can be utilized to control how the overflow is handled.

# 2. Understanding Overflow Property
## 2.1 Overflow Values
The overflow property can take various values, such as:

- `visible`: Content overflows the box without any clipping.
- `hidden:` Content is clipped, and the overflow is hidden.
- `scroll:` Scrollbars are added to the box, allowing users to scroll through the overflow.
- `auto:` Scrollbars appear only when there's overflow, providing a dynamic solution.
# 3. Practical Examples with Code
## 3.1 Example 1 - Scrollbar Always Visible
```css
.box1 {
    width: 40vw;
    height: 40vw;
    border: 2px solid black;
    overflow: scroll;
}
```
In this example, the `overflow: scroll;` property is used. It ensures that vertical and horizontal scrollbars are always visible, even if there is no overflow.
## 3.2 Example 2 - Scrollbar Appears on Overflow
```css
.box2 {
    width: 40vw;
    height: 40vw;
    border: 2px solid black;
    overflow: auto;
    white-space: nowrap;
}
```
- Here, `overflow: auto;` is used. Scrollbars appear only when there's overflow. 
- Additionally, `white-space: nowrap;` prevents text from wrapping, creating a horizontal scrollbar. Text doesn't come in vertical direction but in a horizontal direction only with a scrollbar.
## 3.3 Example 3 - Managing Overflow X and Y
```css
.box3 {
    width: 40vw;
    height: 40vw;
    border: 2px solid black;
    overflow: hidden scroll;
    /* overflow-x: hidden;
    overflow-y: scroll; */
}
```
- The `overflow: hidden scroll;` property is used to manage overflow separately in the x and y directions. 
- `overflow-x: hidden;` hides overflow in the horizontal direction, and 
- `overflow-y: scroll;` shows a vertical scrollbar.
## 3.4 Additional Properties - White Space and Text Overflow
```css
.box3 {
    /* ... other styles ... */
    white-space: nowrap;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```
- These additional properties prevent text wrapping (`white-space: nowrap;`) and add an `ellipsis (...)` to indicate text overflow (`text-overflow: ellipsis;`).

### 1. white-space: nowrap;
The white-space property in CSS is used to control how whitespace inside an element is handled. Setting it to nowrap prevents text from wrapping to the next line. Here's a breakdown:

- `white-space` Property: It has various values, and nowrap is one of them.
- `nowrap Value:` It indicates that the text should not wrap to the next line. It forces the content to stay on a single line.

Example:
```css
Copy code
.box3 {
    /* ... other styles ... */
    white-space: nowrap;
}
```
Use Case:
-
In the provided example, `white-space: nowrap;` is applied to the .box3 element. This ensures that the text content within .box3 will stay on a single line, regardless of the container's width. It is particularly useful when dealing with inline elements or situations where breaking the text is not desired.

---

### 2. text-overflow: ellipsis;
The `text-overflow` property is used to specify how overflowed content should be indicated when it exceeds the dimensions of a box. The ellipsis value adds an `ellipsis (...)` at the end of the content to signify that more text is present but not fully visible.

`text-overflow` Property: It determines how the text content should behave when it overflows its containing element.
`ellipsis` Value: When set to ellipsis, it adds an ellipsis at the end of the overflowed text.

Example:
```css
Copy code
.box3 {
    /* ... other styles ... */
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```
Use Case:
-
- In the example, `text-overflow: ellipsis;` is applied to .box3. If the text content within .box3 exceeds its dimensions, an ellipsis will be displayed at the end of the visible text, indicating that there is more content not currently visible.
